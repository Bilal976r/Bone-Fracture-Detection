# Bone-Fracture-Detection
Bone Fracture Detection using deep learning. This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify fractures in the elbow, hand, and shoulder. Trained on the MURA dataset, it aims to automate fracture detection with high accuracy, leveraging musculoskeletal radiograph data.
