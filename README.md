# Bone-Fracture-Detection
Bone Fracture Detection using deep learning. This project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify fractures in the elbow, hand, and shoulder. Trained on the MURA dataset, it aims to automate fracture detection with high accuracy, leveraging musculoskeletal radiograph data.

## Features
- Automated detection of bone fractures.
- Classifies fractures across multiple bone types: elbow, hand, and shoulder.
- Visualizes model performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
- OpenCV for image processing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bone-fracture-detection.git
    cd bone-fracture-detection
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Download the MURA dataset** (instructions in the Dataset section below).

## Usage
1. **Prepare the dataset**: Place the MURA dataset in the appropriate directory as specified in the code.
2. **Train the model**: Run the training script to start training the model:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```
3. **Evaluate the model**: Use the evaluation script to assess the model's accuracy:
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## Dataset
The project uses the MURA dataset, a large collection of musculoskeletal radiographs. You need to download it separately from [Stanford ML Group's website](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/).

- Extract the dataset into a folder named `data` in the project directory.

## Results
The model's accuracy, confusion matrix, and other performance metrics will be displayed after training and evaluation. You can customize the visualization scripts for more in-depth analysis.
